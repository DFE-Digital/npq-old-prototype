  <p>To be eligible for scholarship funding for the {{ data.register.course }} you must work in one of these settings in England:
  </p>

  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>state-funded schools</li>
    <li>state-funded 16 to 19 organisations</li>
    <li>independent special schools</li>
    <li>virtual schools</li>
    <li>hospital schools</li>
    <li>young offender institutions</li>


  </ul>


  <p>You can still register for {{ data.register.course }}, but you need to pay for it another way. Contact your course provider to discuss your funding options.</p>
