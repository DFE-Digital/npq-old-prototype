      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Available courses</h2>
      <p>From September 2021, NPQ courses previously offered will be changed.</p>
      <p>These changes include:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>the three existing NPQs in Senior Leadership, Headship and Executive Leadership have been refreshed, ensuring that they are underpinned by the latest evidence of what works</li>
        <li>replacing the current NPQ in middle leadership with 3 new NPQs for teachers and leaders who want to develop their expertise in specialist areas of teaching practice:
          <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>supporting the training and development of others</li>
            <li>developing teachers who are subject leads or responsible for improving teaching practice in a subject or phase</li>
            <li>developing teachers who have responsibilities for leading behaviour and culture</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>These will be known as:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>NPQ Senior Leadership</li>
        <li>NPQ Executive Leadership</li>

      </ul>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Additional Support Offer for new headteachers</h2>

      <p>From autumn 2021 the additional support offer is a new targeted support package for teachers new to the role of headship. </p>

      <p>It is for new headteachers in their first 2 years of a headship role who have either completed an NPQH or are currently taking an NPQH.</p>
