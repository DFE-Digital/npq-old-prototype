      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Why do I need this?</h2>

      <p class="govuk-body">
        Everyone needs a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/teacher-reference-number-trn">TRN</a> to register for an NPQ. You do not need to be a teacher to get a TRN. 
      </p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Request a TRN by email</h2>
      
      <p class="govuk-body">
       If you’ve never been given a TRN, email the Teaching Regulation Agency at qts.enquiries@education.gov.uk. The team aim to respond to valid email requests within 5 working days.
      </p>

      <p class="govuk-body">
        You’ll need to provide contact details and proof of ID to receive a TRN.
