      <p>This can happen if:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>you use a shared email address</li>
        <li>you use an email address someone used before (for example a headteacher email address that a previous headteacher would have used)</li>
        <li>you used your email address to register other people</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">How to continue</h2>

      <p>Try registering with a different email address, one that only you have access&nbsp;to.</p>
      <p>If youâ€™re registering on behalf of someone else, they will need to register using their own email address.</p>
