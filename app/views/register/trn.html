<p>Your teacher reference number (TRN) is used to check youâ€™re eligible to study for an NPQ.</p>
  
<p>You can use the <a href="https://find-a-lost-trn.education.gov.uk/start" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" >Find a lost TRN service (opens in a new tab)</a> if you do not know your TRN, or want to check if you have one.</p>

<p>You may not have a TRN if you are working in early years, further education or qualified as a teacher outside England.</p>
